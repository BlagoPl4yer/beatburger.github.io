## How to help

Currently, the priority is to fill out the Robopedia and the botpack modules list. Most of everything we need is on the discord already, now it's a matter of properly formatting it so we can include the data.

### Method 1: the collective bot spreadsheet

It's on discord, just fill out anything that's still missing

### Method 2: plain-text description cards

Basically copy one of the "empty template" files below and fill it with the appropriate data for the bot/ability (for now) you want to submit:

- [Bot template example](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/raw/main/_bots/chomp.md) - [Empty bot template](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/raw/main/_helpers/empty-bot.md)
- [Ability template example](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/raw/main/_abilities/gust.md) - [Empty ability template](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/raw/main/_helpers/empty-ability.md)
- [Guide page example](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/raw/main/guides/getting-started.md)

[Then ping us on discord](https://discord.gg/FsJzvtFrgq) (Groovy or Pix for now) to share your work, and we'll include it to the current version.

- If no data is relevant or you don't have it, just leave it empty ( "" ).
- Happy to assist and answer any questions so I can make this page better for the next volunteers !

Any other idea you have to contribute, let us know !
