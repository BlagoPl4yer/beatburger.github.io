### 'Full Damage Build' by Hex
- **BBCBB:** Upon drop he spins, crits, stuns and 1 hit an enemy. Would recommend equip with crit boosters.

### 'Different Build' by Hex
- **AACAB:** Everything that a full damage build lacks, it got speed. 

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
The big daddy of burst DPS. With the proper AI picks, Brute can pull out an Overclocked Spin that pumps out 13790 damage in a single hit, one-shotting over 70% of the current bots. Brute also has great crit AI if you're looking to go for a crit build, upgrading his Overclocked Spin to a bigger 27580 damage. That's somewhat overkill though, since the highest HP commonly used tank has little over 20k. Tier A+.

### Tips
Good for clearing out grouped bots, Best use when Ai is Maxed out
