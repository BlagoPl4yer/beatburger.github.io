### Evaluation by Soft
One of the best bots in the early game, Froggy significantly starts dropping off in damage and usefulness past level ~10. His damage simply isn't where it used to be and he gets easily countered by botpack abilities, chasers with smart AI choices or simple bot abilities. Still the cutest mascot of the game though. Tier B.
