### Tips
Put Bullwark in the front weakness is his rear since his shield is in the front

### 'Full Tank Build' by Hex
- **BBCBB:** Strongest Defense is the best offense. Bullwark have a shield that can reflect damage and damage reduction by 30%.

### Attack Tank Build by Hex
- **ABCAA:** You can run but you can't hide from an attack tank, it protects and attacks at the same time.
