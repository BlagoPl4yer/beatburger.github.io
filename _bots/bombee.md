Hard to use consistently in any competitive or challenging setting.\n- Speciality: enters with a Boom, hopefully exits with a Boom\n- Note: it won't explode if you keep it away from any Ult target\n"

### 'Bombee Tank' by Hex
- **BABCB:** Ai1 and Ai3 are Health.

### 'Speed Bombee' by Hex
- **BAACB:** Drop and pray it picks a glass bot, with its speed boost it can follow a target or pushes a target and self destructs on a distance.

### 'Melee Bombee' by Hex
- **ABACA:** A different option for bombee but still explodes in the end. 

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
Formerly an A+ tier bot, it was possible to ignore his own Self-Destruct damage with a well-timed [Shield](/Shield) ability, but since that nerf Bombee has had trouble finding a place in most teams. He can be countered quite easily by stalling his ultimate with plenty of abilities or simply killing him before it goes off. His win condition is killing himself to trade with another bot, which is pretty poor.
 Tier B-.

### Tips
Great for farming Ai Xp, only used in grouped wild bots. 
It is also a great if combo with flamer and bombee. 
Bombee pushes enemy which also a great 1-time use tank.
