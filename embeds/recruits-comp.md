Every recruit fight is simulated, so comp synergies (bots+abilities+boosters) matter! A good recruit can punch above its weight.

Recruit Comp tips:
- Recruits are dumb.    Assume every tool you give them, they will use it wrong.
- Avoid easily-disabled bots:    low mobility + melee range, or low defenseless ranged
- Prioritize self-reliant bots:    high mobility and/or range and/or tanky
- Idem abilities:    avoid any that don't have guaranteed impact and could potentially be a waste of power
- Spectate your Recruit Comps:    see by yourself what works and what doesn't
