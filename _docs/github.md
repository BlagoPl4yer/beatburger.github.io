# Github

## Get access

1 - Create a github account (https://github.com/)
2 - Tell me your username, I send you an invite to "beatburger/beatburger.github.io"
3 - visit https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/invitations, accept


## Deployment

- Github uses Jekyll to convert all of our .md files and mix them into .html files that make up the actual website.
- This process is called *build, and happens regularly after Github detects a file has changed. The actual time can vary, anything from 10s to a couple minutes is usual.
- Successful builds are *deployed* for the world to see, builds that fail are not.
- Every step of this process is documented live at https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages 

Hopefully you will never have to dig too much into these reports, but when you push an update it's handy to know when it's actually been built.
