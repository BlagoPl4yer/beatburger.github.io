# Conventions

## URLs and Filenames formats

A strict naming convention is to be enforced: 

- 1. small caps
- 2. no spaces (use: -)
- 3. no special characters (replace special letters with the closer one from a-z, replace signs with -)
- 4. never more than 1 consecutive -
- 5. no starting or ending with -
- 6. in case of entities, every word should be used (in full), including articles
- ..?

Notable exception:

According to these rules, https://www.botworld.wiki/ko should be https://www.botworld.wiki/k-o, and thus https://www.botworld.wiki/assets/img/bots/ko.png should be https://www.botworld.wiki/assets/img/bots/k-o.png. We keep it for legacy's sake even though it breaks rule 3.
