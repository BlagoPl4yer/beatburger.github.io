Your top priority is to **avoid the Freeze Balls**. Two ways around it:

- have a lucky battlefield with obstacles. Can't have that every time, but you will eventually.
- have Chaos Translocator (CT) at hand and save power to use it in a pinch


Ps: I believe Proximity Translocator can be used instead of CT and work considerably better. I didn't have it myself

Then, tip your comp heavily towards **ranged bots so you can kill from afar**. Some Chasers are cool, but def no tanks.

**Must-have abilities**: CT, [Imobilize](/immobilize). **Good to have**: [Gust](/gust), [Freeze](/freeze), Overcharge

- Boosters to help generate power.


The more snipers you have, the better. **Longshot is king and easy to get**, Chomp is so-so but okay. Put them down on the field, keep the enemies away with Imobilize/Gust/Freeze, save 2p for CT to dodge Freeze Ball, and occasionally Overcharge if you can afford it.

Some hidden gems amongst bots:

- **[Rocketeer](/rocketeer) AI3**: with the knockback effect, it can keep mobs away virtually forever. 100% can easily solo [Brute](/brute), and then some.
- **[Slicer](/slicer) AI4**: immune to slow and freeze. Great [Frosty](/frosty) counter.
