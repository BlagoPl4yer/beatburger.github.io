# Exploring



<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">

Not to be confused with [Farming](/farming), Exploring is when you need to make the most out of every bit of Canister juice you got!

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-canister">

## Cannister

You get 1 Cannister bar, and 1 HP bar. You lose HP in a fight, and your Cannister Energy heals you up between fights.

If you fight multiple mobs simultanously or to fast to heal in-between, you can die and get sent back to town with Can Energy left!

Don't worry, you don’t actually die or lose anything besides you Can Energy left.

</div>


## Mob Encounters

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-mobs">

### Danger color codes

Mobs display their level in different colors to give you an idea of the danger level of fighting them:

- **Red:** dangerous, high ai exp gain, 3 or more levels higher than self botpack level
- **Orange:** less dangerous than red, medium-high exp gain, 1 or 2 more levels higher than self botpack level
- **Yellow:** fight with caution, medium ai exp gain, same or 1 or 2 levels lower than self botpack level
- **Green:** easy, low ai exp gain, 3 levels lower than self botpack level


### Wild bots

- All there at the begining of the fight
- **Notably Drop:** [Sparky Wires](</sparky-wires>), [Hard Botplates](</hard-botplates>)


### Bandits

- Place bots at the same time as you do, so you can't plan quite as much.
- They have a full [Botpack](</botpack>), that means abilities and boosters!
- **Notably Drop:** x-xx Gold, [Clear Oil](</clear-oil>), [Glass Tube](</glass-tube>)


There are 5 types of bandits:

- **Cats:** Just your ordinary bandit. Can mount cannons.
- **Rats:** Can mount cannons, grapple hooks, or energy blasters.
- **Dog:** Ability to run extremely fast and can outrun you.
- **Lizard:** Bandits with slowing nets.
- **Buffalo:** Has an ability to charge at you, annoying to run into. Notably drop [Thick Oil](</thick-oil>)


### Mega Bots

They’re big and sometime nasty. They have a skull logo

**Interesting Counters:**[Bigshot](</bigshot>), [Rocketeer](</Rocketeer>), [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>)...

### Bosses

Same as megabots. You get [Season Reward Tokens](</seasons>) for beating them!

</div>



## Multiple Enemies

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-multiple">

- Doing multi-fights can be great for extra scrap thanks to the [Risk Reward Business Upgrade](/business#scrap). 
- Also some [Bots](/materials) or [Boat](/boat-materials) can only be found by winning multi-fights
- It doesn't seem to benefit to do 3+ fights at once.
- Your [Canister](#canister) can't heal you between fights, so be careful!
- **Tip:** When expecting a difficult multi-fight, be proactive and use your best gadgets early on so your A-team is still up for the next fights!
- **Notably Drops:** [Frost Fuel](/frost-fuel), [Matte Coating](/matte-coating), [Support Chip](/support-chip)

</div>

## Level Scaling

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-scaling">

Mobs level grows to be at minimun **3 below your [Botpack level](/botpack#botpack-level)**

</div>



<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-critters">

## Critters

All the **rabbits, scarabs, snakes**, etc.

- Catch them by walking upon them
- They drop scraps, notably: [Mini Sensor](/mini-sensor), [Brawler Batteries](/brawler-battery)
- They spawn/despawn when you start a fight
- Some flee, some attack and hurt

See their every locations at [Maps](/maps)

### Behaviors

- **Meek:** Blue Beetles, Green Frogs 
- **Aggressive**: Black Scorpions, Red Snakes, Snakes

### Catching Tips

- Saltwater Swamp is packed with snakes

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-contracts">

## Contracts

They're discussed in [Contracts](</contracts>), but make sure any occasion you have to go out you actually complete some!

Also, some special contracts are actually quests... New page?

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-encounters">

## Random Encounters

Quizzes, prisoners, etc

</div>


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-tips">

## Tips and Tricks

### Map reset

Reset any map by leaving/rentering them. Everything will respawn

To save rare critters like rainbow snake or ruby scarab, don't battle, or let your recruits do that. Critters spawn/despawn while battling.

### Avoid ennemies

Wild bots and bandits have a shorter range of detection on their back.

While they are chasing you, run (unless you want to battle), and **don't turn too much**.

Be unpredictable when escaping bandits controlling grapple cannon
