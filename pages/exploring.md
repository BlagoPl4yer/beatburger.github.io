## Cannister

You get 1 Cannister bar, and 1 HP bar. You los HP in a fight, and your Cannister Energy heals you up between fights.

If you fight multiple mobs simultanously or to fast to heal in-between, you can die and get sent back to town with Can Energy left!

Don't worry, you don't actually die or lose anything besides you Can Energy left.
