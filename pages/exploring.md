<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-canister">

## Canister

You get 1 Canister bar, and 1 HP bar. You los HP in a fight, and your Canister Energy heals you up between fights.

If you fight multiple mobs simultanously or to fast to heal in-between, you can die and get sent back to town with Can Energy left!

Don't worry, you don't actually die or lose anything besides you Can Energy left.


</div>


## Mob Encounters

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-mobs">

### Danger color codes

Mobs display their level in different colors to give you an idea of the danger level of fighting them:

- **Red:** dangerous, high ai exp gain
- **Yellow:** fight with caution, medium ai exp gain
- **Green:** easy, low ai exp gain

### Wild bots

All there at the begining of the fight


### Bandits

Place bots at the same time as you do, so you can't plan quite as much.

They have a full [Botpack](/botpack), that means abilities and boosters!

### Mega Bots

They're big and sometime nasty. They have a skull logo

### Bosses

Same. You get [Season Reward Tokens](/seasons) for beating them!


</div>



## Multiple Enemies

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-multiple">

- Doing multi-fights can be great for extra scrap thanks to the [Risk Reward Business Upgrade](/business#scrap). 
- Also some [Bots](/materials) or [Boat](/boat-materials) can only be found by winning multi-fights
- It doesn't seem to benefit to do 3+ fights at once.
- Your [Canister](#canister) can't heal you between fights, so be careful!
- **Tip:** When expecting a difficult multi-fight, be proactive and use your best gadgets early on so your A-team is still up for the next fights!

</div>

## Level Scaling

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-scaling">

Mobs level grows to be at minimun **3 below your [Botpack level](/botpack#botpack-level)**

</div>



<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-critters">

## Critters

All the **rabbits, scarabs, snakes**, etc.

- Catch them by walking upon them
- They drop scraps & sometimes [Brawler Batteries](/brawler-battery)
- They spawn/despawn when you start a fight
- Some flee, some attack and hurt

See their every locations at [Maps](/maps)

### Behaviors
