# Exploring



<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">

Not to be confused with [Farming](/farming), Exploring is when you need to make the most out of every bit of Canister juice you got!

</div>


<ul class="page-toc toc-block-list links">
  <li class="toc-block-entry" ><a href="#canisters">Canisters</a></li>
  <li class="toc-block-entry" ><a href="#mob-encounters">Mob Encounters</a></li>

</ul>

- **Maps**: they're all in [Maps](/maps)
- **Danger Zones**: get your fuel ready! [Danger Zones](/danger-zones)
- **Contracts**: See the full list on the [dedicated Contracts page](/contracts)

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-canister">

## Canister

You get 1 Canister bar, and 1 HP bar. You los HP in a fight, and your Canister Energy heals you up between fights.

If you fight multiple mobs simultanously or to fast to heal in-between, you can die and get sent back to town with Can Energy left!

Don't worry, you don't actually die or lose anything besides you Can Energy left.


</div>


## Mob Encounters

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-mobs">

### Wild bots

All there at the begining of the fight


### Bandits

Place bots at the same time as you do, so you can't plan quite as much.

They have a full [Botpack](/botpack), that means abilities and boosters!

### Mega Bots

They're big and sometime nasty. They have a skull logo

### Bosses

Same. You get [Season Reward Tokens](/seasons) for beating them!


</div>



## Multiple Enemies

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-multiple">

- Doing multi-fights can be great for extra scrap thanks to the [Risk Reward Business Upgrade](/business#scrap). 
- Also some [Bots](/materials) or [Boat](/boat-materials) can only be found by winning multi-fights
- It doesn't seem to benefit to do 3+ fights at once.
- Your [Canister](#canister) can't heal you between fights, so be careful!
- **Tip:** When expecting a difficult multi-fight, be proactive and use your best gadgets early on so your A-team is still up for the next fights!

</div>

## Level Scaling

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-scaling">

Mobs level grows to be at minimun **3 below your [Botpack level](/botpack#botpack-level)**

</div>



<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-critters">

## Critters

All the **rabbits, scarabs, snakes**, etc.

- Catch them by walking upon them
- They drop scraps & sometimes [Brawler Batteries](/brawler-battery)
- They spawn/despawn when you start a fight
- Some flee, some attack and hurt

See their every locations at [Maps](/maps)

### Behaviors

- **Fleeing:** White Rabbits, Black Rats
- **Meek:** Blue Beetles, Green Frogs 
- **Aggressive**: Black Scorpions, Red Snakes, Snakes

### Catching Tips

- To catch a lot easily, hunt the aggressive ones
- Saltwater Swamp is packed with snakes

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-contracts">

## Contracts

They're discussed discussed in [Contracts](/contracts), but make sure any occasion you have to go out you actually complete some!

Also, some special contracts are actually quests... New page?


</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-encounters">

## Random Encounters

Quizzes, prisoners, etc

</div>


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-tips">

## Tips and Tricks

### Map reset

reset any map by leaving/rentering them. Everything will respawn

</div>
