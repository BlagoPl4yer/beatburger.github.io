# Custom challenges and game modes

## Spice up your adventures

- **Why?** Because it’s fun silly
- **How?** We have a few rulesets already, tried and fun. Use them, or adjust to your liking
- **With who?** We have a thread and lobby on discord

**Note:** This is a special addition that isn't official in the game, a Pix initiative and it’s all happening in the discord server!

## Group Danger Zones

It's better with friends!

**Custom Danger Zones Lobby** (Custom DZ Lobby) is a discord thread where we organize challenges that **spice up your Danger Zone trip** by limiting what bots, abilities and boosters you can use to a specific rarity or restrictions that can significantly makes the trip even harder

**Setup the time for a run** with everyone interested, decide together what DZ it'll be today, then go!


### “Group DZ” Goals and Conditions

You must play with more than 2 people including yourself and your goal is to **clear the map** by visiting all (?) events, defeat all bosses, collect all chests and stopping by all stations (gadget and canister recharge stations) marked on your map!

## Trust & Proofs

It’s all for fun and not competitive, so not a strict requitement. 

We’re just all trusting each other that we’re following the rules. Still, if you want to make it competitive, or if you have some extraordinary performances to show off, it’s good to ensure your claims aren’t contestable. 
Here’s a protocol and list of proofs that will make any Pauper DZ claim uncontestable:
