# Custom Danger Zones Lobby!

### Introduction

**Custom Danger Zones Lobby** (Custom DZ Lobby) is a discord thread where we organize challenges that **spice up your Danger Zone trip** by limiting what bots, abilities and boosters you can use to a specific rarity or restrictions that can significantly makes the trip even harder

TBW: Why? Because it’s fun silly

### “Group DZ” Goals and Conditions

TBW: Why is that fun?

You must play with more than 2 people including yourself and your goal is to **clear the map** by visiting all (?) events, defeat all bosses, collect all chests and stopping by all stations (gadget and canister recharge stations) marked on your map!

- **Note:** This is a special addition that isn't official in the game, a Pix initiative and it’s all happening in the discord server!

## All Challenges

### Pauper DZ Challenge

**Requirements**:

- Your loadout must consists of ONLY **Commons** and **Special** bots, abilities and boosters
- [Gadgets](</botpack#gadgets>) are allowed
- [Recruits](</recruits>) are exceptional: they can have bots, abilities and boosters of any rarity<br>



![Loadout example](<https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/993917728773636116/994310115723321395/IMG_20220707_013313.jpg>)<br>

Once you've followed the requirements above, select any **Danger Zone** and the challenge is started!

**Goal**: Your goal is to visit all events on your map and have them **checkmarked**

**Recommended gadgets**: Invisibility, Shockwave Generator and Bombardment

**Tips on completion**:

- Avoid any fights necessary to preserve your repair canister for bosses
- Use **Recruits** and **Gadgets** strategically to avoid fights or to lower boss's health

**Proofs**
It’s all for fun and not competitive, so not a strict requitement. So we’re just all trusting each other that we’re following the rules. Still, if you want to make it competitive, or if you have some extraordinary performances to show off, it’s good to ensure your claims aren’t contestable. 
Here’s a protocol and list of proofs that will make any Pauper DZ claim uncontestable:
