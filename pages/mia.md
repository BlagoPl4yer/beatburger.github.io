# Mia


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">

Mia is a talking bot the player encounters in [Fall Grove](/maps). 

</div>


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-main">

### First Encounter

[Auntie sent us looking for a fairy or something, right?](/contribute#tbw)

[Mia is eating fish at her table ;)](/contribute#tbw)

## Quests

She is then hired by Larry, who requests that all of her belongings (30 pieces, scattered over [Fall Grove](/maps)) be brought to her. While doing this [quest](/contribute#tbw), Larry hosts shows with Mia. They host five a day, and Larry calls her his *Star Attraction*. 

[There are other quests too, I believe ?](/contribute#tbw)

## Background Story


The player eventually discovers that [Mia has been programmed to recall the memories of a Human(3)](/contribute#tbw). The player then either tells her to keep the memories(1) or to delete them(2). After this interaction, Mia leaves, saying that Larry was *fleecing [her] with his outrageous contract*.

**Mia Chen, Passenger ID XX-523786**. A Human who traveled on Arkship 2 but did not make it to Botworld.
