## Locations 

The player can usually find Larry standing to the right of the garden in Scavenger’s Landing. When first encountered, Larry will greet the player, saying:

```
Welcome to Larry’s Luxury Leathergoods and Largely Legitimate Loansharking! What can I do ya for?
```

(PIC2: Introductory screenshot)

His *Luxury Leathergoods* are referenced in a few npc-to-npc dialogues where he says his banners are died with scarab beetle dye. He uses this to justify taking extra money for his sales.

[We can also find him in DZs](/exploring#spots)

## Character

While Larry fancies himself a *con artist*, he usually sells [Cold Batteries](/cold-batteries) to the player for far below [shop](#shop) price. **He is also incredibly hypocritical**, demanding refunds from pirates while not allowing his own customers to refund. His own customers are in for a treat, what with his waiver forms and costly upgrade vouchers. (*Larry’s Spooky Swamp Ghost Cruises*)

**Larry admits to being a scammer**, swindling the player’s dad, and a *con-artist*. 

## Story involvement

### Mia

The first quest involving Larry begins with [Mia](/mia). He's basically exploiting her: they host five a day, and Larry calls her his *Star Attraction*. 

### Ghost Bots

To kick off [the ghost bot quest](/contribute#tbw) in [Saltwater Swamp](/maps), the player goes over to Larry. Larry states his business has been doing well because of the ghost tours around the swamp. However, his ship, the Lizard Queen, was wrecked by a giant ghost bot. The player then has to fight ghost bots and search for 30 waiver forms around Saltwater Swamp. 

### Coggy Batteries

[Larry asks you to sell them to him instead of saving Botworld?](/contribute#tbw)
