## How to help

Currently, the priority is to fill out the Robopedia and the botpack modules list. Most of everything we need is on the discord already, now it's a matter of properly formatting it so we can include the data.


Botworld Wiki gDrive: See on discord
- WikiSheets
- Folders to write pages together but maybe it's not gonna prove useful, ever. 

## Data Collector
Fill out WikiSheets directly, or compile data to fill WikiSheets later on
- Bots WikiSheet: See on discord
- Abilities WikiSheet: See on discord
Data sources outside the gDrive:
- Botworld Adventure Unofficial Wikisheet: See on discord
- Botworld Info by Groovy: See on discord
- Soft's: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12SN-7zkujzGimENE1PVJyDKs99McAdWNKWhU25yzX_M/
- Discord threads: "Bots & Combat overview" , "Abilities List" , "Boosters list" , etc...
