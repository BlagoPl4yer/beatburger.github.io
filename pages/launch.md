# Launch: let's not wait too long ?

The faster we "launch":

- the faster we can benefit from outside help writing content
- the earliest the community benefits from our work
- the earliest we can celebrate
- the less we "risk" someone finding the wiki randomly and spoiling us of the moment

**After the launch**: I suggest we create a new public thread for everyone to come and pitch in about the wiki/content/whatever, but we keep that thread private so we have a HQ to discuss it. Ofc we would invite anyone who's getting involved and proves helpful.

Pix: Here's my own interpretation of the situation, to be discussed if you think otherwise or I forgot anything. The idea is to **concentrate the effort on what we *need* ** and not let the *bonus* stuff block the launch.

**Don't delete anything, ~~strike~~ instead (\~\~like this\~\~)**

## What we need before launch 


### Data


<div markdown="1" class="ghcms ghcms-needdata">

- **Bots**: needs Mort
- **Abilities**: needs pics
- **Boosters**: I'm at peace with the current state
- **Update**: wait for me to green-light it when I'm ready, but we'll need a full update at some point so makes sense to do it before launch imo

</div>

### Content


<div markdown="1" class="ghcms ghcms-needcontent">

- **Menu**: let's discuss what pages we need linked here. eg: Discord link? Maps??
- **Home pages list**: write proper descriptions so people know what the page is about, or what we would love them to write us about so we can create the page.
-**Pages**
  - Bots: missing a bunch of useful stuff, but we can skip it for now ? 
  - Starter Bots: add images ?
  - Botpack: to be written
  - Abilities, Boosters: ok ?
  - Recruits: we can do something minimal quick ?
  - Exploration & DZ Tips: we can do something minimal quick ?
  - Maps: done ?
  - Boat Materials: let's at least explain "Ancient Ruins"
  - Arena: let's describe it briefly ?
  - Arena Masters: let's copy from the discord & make it somewhat useful already
  - Getting Started: ok ?
- **Credits**: double-check everyone's in there

</div>

### Design

<div markdown="1" class="ghcms ghcms-needdesign">

- **Site Banner**: is it okay now ?
- **Font**: we ain't there yet
- **Colors**: is yellow still the right call with the BWA theme ?
- **Menu**: needs some work, and incl. search
- **BWA themes**: homepage blocs OK, now to apply some BWA into Data pages & text sections
- **BWA assets**: logo for every bot class (only brawler for now) + player botpack (+ ?)

</div>

### Features


<div markdown="1" class="ghcms ghcms-needfeature">

- **Editor Mode**: proper setup on every page
- **Images compression**: anyone wants to learn about the requirements here ?

</div>
