## Thank you Featherweight
A big thanks to the devs for their support to our project and this event!

Also it needs to be perfectly clear that this event, like this wiki, is self-organized by community members, and not by FW itself. Any complains (and praise? :P) should be addressed accordingly.

## Important
The goal and purpose of this event is to **introduce more of you to the wiki's internal workings**, have you explore its content a bit more, and walk you through the first steps of **contributing to it**.

### It's a group project
We can only give so many rewards, but you musn't see this as a competition. Or only so much as it may motivate you to write an even more awesome guide than your neighbor. We want to welcome and reward new contributors, and making valuable edits is only part of it. For the event to be a success you will all need to be able to coordinate with each other, collaborate maybe, share tips and help each other definitely.

### You don't need to know how to code!
We've been careful from the start of the project to make it as accessible as possible, to everyone. Regardless of their tech know-how, or hardware. 
Everything that's expected from you in this event can be done with a mobile, even though it's of course often more comfortable from a laptop or desktop.

### You will still have to read and learn some stuff
We wrote tutorials, documentation, etc, to offer every bit of information you should need to do your first steps in the project. 
You will have to read it though.
We will do our best to have people as available as possible to answer any question, and help you through any hiccup. Any help you need, ask about it in the #wiki-contributions thread :)

### This is a volunteer project, with its flaws and limitations
We're very proud of our wiki, but it is still a little side-project built on goodwill and free time. Depending on the reception of this event, we may find out that it struggles to bear the load of too much activity.
We're in this together, and whatever difficulties we encounter, we'll find ways to work around it! Once again, group project, and collaboration.
The same is true to the organization of the wikiweek event itself: if our small team is too solicited, we'll have to rely on other participants to help and guide newcomers.

### Trust, but verify
You will be granted access to change and edit the wiki directly. We expect everyone to act responsibly and be the most considerate of every parties involved: the wiki itself, others contributions, featherweight...
We (wiki staff) won't tolerate any abuse of the access we're sharing, and reserve the right to update the rules accordingly without notice, as well as removing individuals from the event. Up to cancelling the WikiWeek altogether.

Note: this only applies to purposedly harmful behavior. Good-faith mistakes can totally happen, and you musn't be afraid to make some, that's kinda part of the learning process. You will have guidelines to follow to reduce the risk to a minimum, but if you did an oopsie, just let us know as soon as possible and so we can restore it shortly ;)

## Rewards

**Community appreciation**
- Top 10 contributors: 50 gems

**Wiki Staff picks**
- Most impressive content: 50 gems (for long pieces, guides, etc)
- Most helpful hand: 50 gems (for helping others who may struggle with technical stuff)
- Most prolific editor: 50 gems (for making the thousand little edits and fixes everywhere)


## Rules

- Contributions need to be applied to the wiki before the end of the event. Suggestions and ideas are cool too, but this event is about making tangible progress right now.
- Editor Mode credentials will be supplied to you so you can edit text directly.
- Wiki Staff members will do their best to help you every step of the way!
- You will be given access to spreadsheets with all the bots infos, abilities etc., so you can update them and ask for your changes to be applied.
- Any change you want to do but can't see how, we'll do our best to help. If it can't be done during the event, aim smaller for now, and we can pick up your project after :)
- The #wikiweek thread will provide you with all the documentation you need, and is where you will post and edit your contributions. #wiki-contributions is available to discuss anything and help each other out.
- At the end of the event, everyone will be reminded to react on the submissions again so we can have the top 10. Rewards will follow shortly.
- Just because there are rewards doesn't mean it's a competition! The goal is to get everyone familiarized with the wiki editing process, so we can all enjoy having the best wiki possible. Counter-productive behaviors won't be kindly looked upon.
