# Contribute

## Anyone can help!

There's a lot to write still, so much to talk about that isn't covered in the wiki for now!

If you can offer a paragraph to add into any page, any tip or helpful picture, that's how this wiki will grow.

Everything happens on [the official Discord](/https://discord.gg/FsJzvtFrgq), so come and meet us there!

## Roles

The project is loosely structured around the following roles. You don't have to pick one, but it helps to know who does/can do what.

- **Data Collectors**: We have plenty of google sheets that need filling.
- **Writers**: Write content sections, pages, guides etc. 
- **Editors**: Have access to the Editor Mode to quicly edit Wiki pages.
- **Artists**: Make our lovely art.
- **Maintainers**: Can create new bots, abilities, pages etc, and update from WikiSheets.
- **Developper**: Build the Wiki. New features for our users & workflows for our contributors.


## Maintainers

Ask us if you have content ready and need a new page created for it.
