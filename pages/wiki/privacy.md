## Hosting

This wiki is hosted by GitHub Inc. [https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service)


## Cookies required by Google Services

This wiki only uses cookies required to integrate Google Services:

- Google Analytics
- Google Adsense

Cookies are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited. Google Analytics may also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on a website can be evaluated. The information about the usage of our website (including the IP address of the users) generated by cookies and web beacons are transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries. This information might be shared by Google with Google’s contract partners.


## Information about Google services

By integrating Google services, Google may collect and process information (including personal data) about you. It cannot be excluded that Google may also transfer the information to a server in a third country.

As stated in Google’s Privacy Shield certification (you can find it under [https://www.privacyshield.gov/list](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list) by searching for “Google”), Google committed to comply to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework for the collection, usage, and storage of personal data from EU or Swiss member states. Google, including Google LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the USA, has stated via certification to comply to the Privacy Shield principles. Further information can be found at [https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks](https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks).

We ourselves cannot influence which data is collected and processed by Google. However, Google states that, among others, the following information (including personal data) might be processed:

- Protocol data (especially the IP address)
- Location-related information
- Unique application numbers
- Cookies and similar technologies

Information about the types of cookies Google uses can be found at Information about the types of cookies Google uses can be found at [https://policies.google.com/technologies/types](https://policies.google.com/technologies/types).

If you are signed in using your Google account, Google may add the processed information to your account and treat it like personal data, depending on your account settings. To do so, Google does, among others, the following:

> „When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.
When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.“ (https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)

A direct addition of this data can be prevented by logging out of your Google account or by adjusting the appropriate account settings in your Google account. Furthermore, you can prevent the installation of cookies – if Google sets them – by using the appropriate settings in your browser; however we would like to point out that, in this case, you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent.


Further information can be found in Google’s privacy policy, which can be found here: [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)

Information about Google’s privacy settings can be found at [https://privacy.google.com/take-control.html](https://privacy.google.com/take-control.html).



## Usage of Google Analytics

We only use Google Analytics with **IP anonymization enabled (“anonymize IP”)**. This results in the shortening of your IP address by Google within member states of the European Union or other states that are part of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is transmitted to one of Google’s servers in the USA and shortened there.

Furthermore, we concluded a contract of order processing with Google for the use of Google Analytics (art. 28 GDPR). Google processes the data on our behalf in order to evaluate your usage of the website, to compile reports about the website activity for us, and to provide us with further services relating to website and internet usage. Google might transfer this information to third parties when required by law or if third parties process this data on Google’s behalf.

By integrating Google Analytics, we pursue the purpose of analyzing the user behavior on our website and being able to react to it. This enables us to continuously improve our offer.

- The identification cookie is set to **expire after 3 days**.
- The processed information is stored for 26 months and will be deleted automatically at the end of this period.




## Usage of Google Adsense

### Google advertising cookies

Google uses cookies to help serve the ads it displays on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a Google partner's website, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser.

- Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.
- Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
- Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

### Ad personalization

If ad personalization is turned on, Google will use your information to make your ads more useful for you. For example, a website that sells mountain bikes might use Google's ad services. After you visit that site, you could see an ad for mountain bikes on a different site that shows ads served by Google.

If ad personalization is off, Google will not collect or use your information to create an ad profile or personalize the ads Google shows to you. You will still see ads, but they may not be as useful. Ads may still be based on the topic of the website or app you're looking at, your current search terms, or on your general location, but not on your interests, search history, or browsing history. Your information can still be used for the other purposes mentioned above, such as to measure the effectiveness of advertising and protect against fraud and abuse.

When you interact with a website or app that uses Google services, you may be asked to choose whether you want to see personalized ads from ad providers, including Google. Regardless of your choice, Google will not personalize the ads you see if your ad personalization setting is off or your account is ineligible for personalized ads.
