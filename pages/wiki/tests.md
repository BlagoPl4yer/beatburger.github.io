# Recruits Jobs



<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">

## Update: #tbc

if you have added something to the page but the information is not confirmed yet, 
put that piece of info within square brackets [ and ] (just like a link) and add (#tbc) to it.

- For example:
[this is the text that requires confirmation](#tbc)
- Deleting one ')' to show the actual text:
[this is the text that requires confirmation](#tbc

PS: we need better color suggestions for [](#tbc) part :)
