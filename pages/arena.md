## Solo Arena

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-solo">

### Notable Rewards

- 500: [Longshot](/longshot)
- 1000: [Chainer](/chainer)
- 2000: [Pluggie](/pluggie)
- 3000: [Beat](/beat)
- 4000: [Nozzle](/nozzle)
- 5000: [Hornet](/hornet)
- 6000: Crown

### System

- **Opponents:** they're player-created [Comps](/comps), controlled by the game AI.
- **Matchmaking:** You get matched against opponents at around the same rank as yours. If you've been performing better than most people at your level, you'll end up facing harder and harder opponents! 
- **Arena level:** the level displayed in arena isn't the actual [Botpack Level](/botpack#botpack-level), but simply the average of the 6 bots used. It has no impact on anything.
- **Gains/Losses:** The higher your absolute ranking, the less you will earn per win, and the more you will lose per loss. 

| Ranking Range | 0-1k | 1k-2k | 2k-3k | 3k-4k | 4k-5k | 5k+ |
|---------------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| Opponents lvl | 4-11 | 8-13  | 10-16 | 14-21 | 20-25 | 25  |
| Points\*     | +?/-? | +?/-?  | +?/-? | +50/-50 | +3x/-6x | +10/-70  |

- Just know that you will always face outliers, simply because they've performed better or worse than others for their current level
- \* [very rough estimates from memory](/contribute#tbw)

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-brad">

## Brad

Brad is your introduction into the Arena. He won't let you battle the real masters unless you defeat him first.

![300px arenamaster brad](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927876281767452733/arenamaster-brad.png>)

### Tipps:

</div>

### Story

- **Brad:** Hi kid, I'm Brad the Arena Manager, you here to get an autograph from one of the arena masters?
- **Player:** Nope, I've come to take them on!
- **Brad:** One cannot simply enter the Arena, you'll have to do a trial to earn your official botpack first. I warn you, it's tough. And I don't think you're ready...
- **Player:** I was born ready. Who do I fight?
- **Brad:** I can conduct a trial for you. All arena masters are different but I prefer a simple 2v2 format, no reserves.
 
 
After you've defeated Brad:

- **Brad:** Well played kid, maybe you really could join a team and become an arena star one day.
- **Brad:** The actual masters will be much tougher than me, but you've definitely earned your new botpack today.
- **Brad:** It's just a white series botpack. which means it only holds two boosters. But if you defeat an arena master they will upgrade it to a green series.
- **Player:** What are boosters?
- **Brad:** Boosters improve different aspects of your botpack or bot team. The booster you have gives you botpack energy right at the start of the battle.


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-astrid">

## Astrid

Astrid is an arena master who doesn't believe in reserves and likes to deploy all of her 6 bots in the arena preparing for chaos. Nothing but a Chaotic Arena Master

![300px arenamaster astrid](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927891447682842684/arenamaster-astrid.png)

</div>

### Story

- **Astrid:** Waaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Watch where you're going little one, I'm gonna stomp you!
 
 
After you've defeated Astrid:

- **Astrid:** Waaaaaaaaa... Hmmpf. I've gotta admit you can handle yourself in a chaotic fight, you deserve this upgrade to a green series botpack.


## Kelvin

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-kelvin">

Kelvin is a cool Arena Botmaster who uses Frost bots and Frost abilities. He also uses a sniper to support his remaining bots. A very cool Arena Botmaster that likes to cool things.

![300px arenamaster kelvin](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927907161382727700/arenamaster-kelvin.png)

### Tips

- Effective [Sniper Bots](/bots#snipers)
- [Chaser Stun Res](/chaser-stun-resistance-special) or rare [Stun resistance](/stun-resistance-rare) boosters
- [Any more tips we're missing?](/contribute#tbw)

### Story
 
After you've defeated Kelvin:

- **Kelvin:** Wow i got melted, I'm just going to go and chill somehwere for a while. Take your blue series botpack and leave me be.

</div>


## Reginald

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-reginald">

Regi is a dueling master who likes to battle someone with **one bot at a time**. While the rules are simple to fight with, he carries a long-lasting Freeze ability with a stun resistance booster for his bots. A very mean arena master with an attitude.

![300px arenamaster reginald](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927909924317565038/arenamaster-reginald.png)

- **Bots:** = [Slicer](/slicer), [Froggy](/froggy), [Tether](/tether), [Scatter](/scatter), [Longshot](/longshot), [Brute](/brute) Level 14
- **Abilities:** [Speed Boost](</speed-boost>), [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>), [Snowball](/snowball), [Super Charge](/super-charge)

### Tips

Your top priority is to **avoid the Freeze Balls**. Two ways around it:

- have a lucky battlefield with obstacles. Can't have that every time, but you will eventually.
- have [Chaos Translocator](/chaos-translocator) (CT) at hand and save power to use it in a pinch


Ps: I believe [Proximity Translocator](/proximity-translocator) can be used instead of CT and work considerably better. I didn't have it myself

Then, tip your comp heavily towards **ranged bots so you can kill from afar**. Some [Chasers](/bots#chasers) are cool, but def no tanks.

**Must-have abilities**: CT, [Imobilize](/immobilize). 

**Good to have**: [Gust](/gust), [Freeze](/freeze), [Super-Charge](/super-charge)

- Boosters to help generate power, like [Power Start](/power-start-common)


The more snipers you have, the better. **Longshot is king and easy to get**, Chomp is so-so but okay. Put them down on the field, keep the enemies away with Imobilize/Gust/Freeze, save 2p for CT to dodge Freeze Ball, and occasionally Overcharge if you can afford it.

Some hidden gems amongst bots:

- **[Rocketeer](/rocketeer) AI3**: with the knockback effect, it can keep mobs away virtually forever. 100% can easily solo [Brute](/brute), and then some.
- **[Slicer](/slicer) AI4**: immune to slow and freeze. Great [Frosty](/frosty) counter.
- [Any more tips we're missing?](/contribute#tbw)

### Story

- **Reginald:** You offend me with your lack of skill, there will be barely any honour to be gained with my victory.
 
After you've defeated Reginald:

- **Reginald:** I'm finished, done! How can I ever show my face in this town again? Here's your red series botpack, may you glow with its magnificence.

</div>

## Jack

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-jack">

An Arena Master whose bots are **all Melees**. While Jack loves to have Melee bots, he will deploy **4 bots at a time**. 

![300px arenamaster jack](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927915632220045332/arenamaster-jack.png)

- **Bots:** = [Beat](/beat), [Yanky](/yanky), [Chainer](/chainer), [Thump](/thump), 2x [K.O.](/ko) Level 17
- **Abilities:** [Hasty Ground](/hasty-ground), [Charge Field](/charge-field), [Immobilize Field](/immobilize-field), [Vortex](/vortex)


### Tips

- He seems useless against [Unstable plasma](/unstable-plasma), [Bombee](/bombee), [Evaders](/bots#evaders), and [Splashers](/bots#splashers)
- [Any more tips we're missing?](/contribute#tbw)

### Story
 
- **Jack:** C'mon, let's get into it. I'm gonna thump your bots back into scrap. Don't even think of running away.
 
After you've defeated Jack:

- **Jack:** Hmmph, you were just out of my reach. Go on, grab a purple series botpack, knock yourself out!

</div>

After you've defeated Nicola:

- **Nicola:** I've never felt so flat, I'm completely drained, gonna take some time out to recharge. I guess this orange series botpack is yours.

### Trivia

She used to spam [Zap Towers](/zap-tower) like back when that ability was 5p and had a higher rate of fire! Good times...

</div>


## Scales

![300px arenamaster scales](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927919339364028417/arenamaster-scales.png)

### Story

I look forward to our duel, I always enjoy a challenge though I am confident you won't shake me.

After you've defeated Scales:

- **Scales:** I am unsettled... perhaps a new age is dawning. You deserve this prismatic botpack, the most perfectly balanced series that exists.

</div>


## Laydee

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-laydee">

This pop star turned judge waits for you to place bots before delivering her "stunning" verdict. She uses **4 bots at a time and starts placing her bots only after player has put their bots onto the battlefield.

![300px arenamaster laydee](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/985501437733797969/986529332761600060/Screenshot_20220615-124420_Botworld.png)
