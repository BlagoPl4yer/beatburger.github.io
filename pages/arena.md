## Reginald

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-reginald">

Regi is a dueling master who likes to battle someone with **one bot at a time**. While the rules are simple to fight with, he carries a long-lasting Freeze ability with a stun resistance booster for his bots. A very mean arena master with an attitude.

- **Level: 14**
- **Rewards:**

### Bots & Abilities

- [Brute](/brute), [Frosty](/frosty), ?


### Tips

Your top priority is to **avoid the Freeze Balls**. Two ways around it:

- have a lucky battlefield with obstacles. Can't have that every time, but you will eventually.
- have [Chaos Translocator](/chaos-translocator) (CT) at hand and save power to use it in a pinch


Ps: I believe [Proximity Translocator](/proximity-translocator) can be used instead of CT and work considerably better. I didn't have it myself

Then, tip your comp heavily towards **ranged bots so you can kill from afar**. Some [Chasers](/bots#chasers) are cool, but def no tanks.

**Must-have abilities**: CT, [Imobilize](/immobilize). 

**Good to have**: [Gust](/gust), [Freeze](/freeze), [Super-Charge](/super-charge)

- Boosters to help generate power, like [Power Start](/power-start-common)


The more snipers you have, the better. **Longshot is king and easy to get**, Chomp is so-so but okay. Put them down on the field, keep the enemies away with Imobilize/Gust/Freeze, save 2p for CT to dodge Freeze Ball, and occasionally Overcharge if you can afford it.

Some hidden gems amongst bots:

- **[Rocketeer](/rocketeer) AI3**: with the knockback effect, it can keep mobs away virtually forever. 100% can easily solo [Brute](/brute), and then some.
- **[Slicer](/slicer) AI4**: immune to slow and freeze. Great [Frosty](/frosty) counter.
