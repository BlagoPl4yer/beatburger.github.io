## Introduction

To farm Botworld efficiently, you will need:

- **Good recruits**: efficient farming is your [Recruits](/recruits) doing the fighting, while you loot [piles and chests](/loot).
- **Good routes**: different places drop gold at varying amounts, and offer a different selection of [Rare Materials](/materials#rare)
- **Good area knowledge**: As you get to know the precise [spawn location of every potential loot](/maps) and mob for a given area, your performance there will significantly improve. **Especially if your recruits are somewhat lacking**


Gold comes from piles, chests, and bandits. The goal is to loot the most of the first two, and have your recruits defeat the most of the last, in the shortest time possible. **Avoid all fights** as much as possible, and if you can't, make them Multiple Fights so that you cut down on the loading time & make 10% more thanks to the Risky perk.


Some materials are easy to find in high return routes, others not so much. For these, your best bet is to keep an eye on the shop and farm gold to buy them at every occasion.


Every map has a number of potential spawn locations for loot (and mobs). It doesn't guarantee that there will be loot there, there can either be:  Loot, Nothing, Trap turret, or Bandit Canon.


## Young botmasters

(First, let me say that I don't think you should feel the need to dedicate yourself to farming before lvl 15 at the earliest. I started researching it when I was around lvl 17 myself, and it had been pretty easy to upgrade my main bots just doing the story, contracts & arena. )

At the early stages of the game, you will be both limited in your route options, and probably not have that great Recruits. **You can still use these techniques**, and will have to make up for your Recruits shortcomings with some **extra micro-management and running to dodge mobs**. Those you can't run, fight many at once.

The loss of gold/min will be made up for by the opportunity to train any bot you want to improve.

Invisibility is a huge help, just as much as the third recruit. 


This route is rich in Evader Sprays and Splasher Explosive so you should be able to get a 2nd suitable recruit quite soon with such types of bots.

## Relevant Business Upgrades

This is not an absolute ranking of all the upgrades, just of their relevance **to farming**. For example, you should definitively still upgrade the machines first !

- Shared Scrap
- Recruit Repair
- Terrify
- Metal Detector
- Cannister Storage
- Negociation
- Treasure Hunter
- Risk Reward
- Shakedown (doesn't seem to have an effect on gold, just scrap)
- Scavenger Training

Note: the weakest your recruits and the more you get into fights, the more valuable the last 2 get


## Build up your Recruits 

What's important is that your recruits can handle as many fights as possible, so you don't have to. Thus, **give them your best bots & abilities** when you go for a farming run. 

I usually only keep to myself Chainer + a direct damage ability, so I can win a fight fast when I messed up and got into one. It's a great opportunity to train 2 new bots !


Now, for your recruits to do well, you want the mobs they'll face to be as weak as possible. Mobs are at the minimum 3 levels below your current level. So you want to **keep your recruits level as close as possible to your own level**.

**Your own level is calculated from the average of your best 6 bots**. Watch it and be careful when upgrading bots not to just push your top 6 through the roof and leave your recruits hanging.

If you don't have enough bots to have all your recruits well stuffed, concentrate your best bots in 1 then 2 of them. **It's better to have 2 recruits who can fight, and one that you use only as a diversion, than to have 3 that will get down in no time**.

Note: your bots will not gain any XP when used by Recruits. You'll have to **train them yourself first** !

Check out "Recruits Chat, Comps & Strategies" to discuss or take inspiration from the community.


## Farming tips & tricks

Check out the far left of the **shop for extra canisters** (behind ads if you don't have the Mayoral Membership). 

### How to navigate a route

- In most routes, you want to **make sure your recruits can deal with the mobs that guard loot or block your way**, while the rest is only optional. This may require some micro-management, usually by not deploying all 3 of them right from the start but keeping them to where they're the most needed.
- Use the **Bombardment gadget (lvl2)** on large groups to help your recruits win fights easier and save up health (thx @birdsound#0152)
- **Tank the energy canons** so it doesn't hurt your recruits instead. 
- Be very careful for them around mines.


- A neat trick by @Atreyus#0204 that will tank your gold/min but save you canisters if you find yourself short: you can reset your current map (and loot) by leaving/re-entering the area by foot.


### Completing contracts

A few contracts are not based upon a specific location and can be completed while running most routes:

- Loot X chests / piles
- Fight X bandits / Wild bots
- Disarm X mines

You can cancel and reroll contracts that don't fit. It can't be worth it if you don't have the Mayoral Membership that allows you to skip ads though, and even then I don't do it anymore because it's very tedious actually.

Still, if you have such contracts, pick and chose a route that will allow you to complete it.

### What makes a good farming route

- can drop the type of **materials** you're looking for
- can be **completed by your recruits** while fighting as little possible yourself (the goal is 0)
- doesn't make you run around too much

The last two will allow you to get good gold/min performances. Data shows that **the best routes are around 2-4 min/run**, so if you're running for much longer consider trimming it down.

Keep it short, make bank !



## Routes

A good route will have a high density of [Piles and Chests](/loot), have the desired characteristics for the [Materials](/materials) you're looking for, and usually have more [Bandits](/exploring#bandits) than [Wild Bots](/exploring#wild-bots) since they drop Gold.

**You will always be looking for gold**, but when you also need specifically some other materials it might be worth it to run an alternative route to have a chance to drop it. **At 475 gold/rare drop**, and \~1 drop/3runs (7min30), it represents **about 63 extra gold/min**. Even just [Sparky Wires](/sparky-wires) make it worth it to have [Wild Bots](/wild-bots) in your route, even if that decreases your gold earnings. **It's all about compromise**.

### Special

Pretty sure there's a good farming route for it all in Spore Wood... [to be researched](/contribute#tbw)

- [Thick Oil](/thick-oil): [Buffalo Bandits](/exploring#bandits)
- [Mini Sensor](/mini-sensor), [Brawler Battery](/brawler-battery): [Critters](/critters)


### Not Farmable

**Botframes:** Read the section about [Finding Botframes](/loot#botframes).

Not saying they can't be found, but I don't see a way to reliably get to a satisfying drop rate per minute for the following:

[Cold Battery](/cold-battery), [Frost Fuel](/frost-fuel), [Hardened Fiberglass](/hardened-fiberglass), [Sputtering Generator](/sputtering-generator), [Jet Fuel](/jet-fuel), [Matte Coating](/matte-coating), [Tangled Wires](/tangled-wires), [Sniper Gyro](/sniper-gyro), [Support Chip](/support-chip)

I suggest you take every opportunity you get to collect them by other means ([Shop](/shop) & [Recruit Jobs](/jobs)).
