### Botworld Wiki Launch
__**Hello Everyone!**__

We, Beat Burger & Friends, are most excited to present to you the brand new and shiny: **Botworld Adventure community Wiki**

![Beat Burger by Lollitree](/assets/img/pics/beatburger.png)

It's been a project running strong for the last 10 days or so, and today we believe it is ready enough to present it to you!

It is *ready*, but **far from complete**! Many (most?) of the pages are shadows of what we want them to be, created as placeholder so we can fill them up together over the weeks to come.

We have some very nice and rich ones though, have a look at:

- [Bots](/bots)
- [Botpack](/botpack)
- [Materials](/materials) 

For example. 

We very much hope you like it, where it can go, and hopefully send us some stuff that you noticed is still missing and you have some info.

**Have a look at it now, and tell us what you think!**
