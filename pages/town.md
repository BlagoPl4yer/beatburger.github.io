## Boat

It's nice, and the business there grows bigger as you [Upgrade your Boat](/boat). Go to this page for everything about upgrades & stuff. Stay here to read some fluff I guess.

## Hairdesser

She can cut your hair or grow you scales. She's that good. **costs: ??**

## Auntie

She does your fusing for you.

You need **3 of the very same [Botpack Module](/botpack)** for it to work (ex. 3 [Shields](/shield)). Fusing is **always random** and irreversible.

## Hack

She builds your [Gadgets](/botpack#gadgets), and you have to pay her, and she's also part of the story at some point.

## Arena

See [Arena](/arena) and [Arena Masters](/arena-masters) for gameplay stuff, but here read about all the cool fluff and hidden NPCs interractions


## Story NPCs

### Larry

### Mayor
