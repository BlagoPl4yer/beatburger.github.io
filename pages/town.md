## Boat

It's nice, and the business there grows bigger as you [Upgrade your Boat](/boat). Go to this page for everything about upgrades & stuff. Stay here to read some fluff I guess.

## Hairdesser

She can cut your hair or grow you scales. She's that good. **costs: ??**

## Auntie

She does your fusing for you.

You need **3 of the very same [Botpack Module](/botpack)** for it to work (ex. 3 [Shields](/shield)). Fusing is **always random** and irreversible.

## Hack

She builds your [Gadgets](/botpack#gadgets), and you have to pay her, and she's also part of the story at some point.

## Arena

See [Arena](/arena) and [Arena Masters](/arena-masters) for gameplay stuff, but here read about all the cool fluff and hidden NPCs interractions


## Story NPCs


### Mayor

## Larry

Larry is a mostly red lizard with white spikes. He has two sets on his head which resemble slicked-back hair and a goatee. There are four spikes on his tail. Larry typically wears a striped blue suit and a white shirt underneath.

### Locations 

The player can usually find Larry standing to the right of the garden in Scavenger’s Landing. When first encountered, Larry will greet the player, saying:

```
Welcome to Larry’s Luxury Leathergoods and Largely Legitimate Loansharking! What can I do ya for?
```

(PIC2: Introductory screenshot)

His *Luxury Leathergoods* are referenced in a few npc-to-npc dialogues where he says his banners are died with scarab beetle dye. He uses this to justify taking extra money for his sales.

### Character

While Larry fancies himself a *con artist*, he usually sells [Cold Batteries](/cold-batteries) to the player for far below [shop](#shop) price. **He is also incredibly hypocritical**, demanding refunds from pirates while not allowing his own customers to refund. His own customers are in for a treat, what with his waiver forms and costly upgrade vouchers. (*Larry’s Spooky Swamp Ghost Cruises*)

### Story involvement

The first quest involving Larry begins with [Mia](/contribute#tbw). Mia is a talking bot the player encounters in [Fall Grove](/maps). She is then hired by Larry, who requests that all of her belongings (30 pieces, scattered over [Fall Grove](/maps)) be brought to her. While doing this [quest](/contribute#tbw), Larry hosts shows with Mia. They host five a day, and Larry calls her his *Star Attraction*. 

The player eventually discovers that [Mia has been programmed to recall the memories of a Human(3)](/contribute#tbw). The player then either tells her to keep the memories(1) or to delete them(2). After this interaction, Mia leaves, saying that Larry was *fleecing [her] with his outrageous contract*.

(2) (PIC4: screenshot of the other response if anyone has it)
(3) **Mia Chen, Passenger ID XX-523786**. A Human who traveled on Arkship 2 but did not make it to Botworld.

To kick off [the ghost bot quest](/contribute#tbw) in [Saltwater Swamp](/maps), the player goes over to Larry. Larry states his business has been doing well because of the ghost tours around the swamp. However, his ship, the Lizard Queen, was wrecked by a giant ghost bot. The player then has to fight ghost bots and search for 30 waiver forms around Saltwater Swamp. 


**Larry admits to being a scammer**, swindling the player’s dad, and a ‘con-artist’.
