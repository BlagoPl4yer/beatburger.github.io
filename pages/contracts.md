- You'll get Contracts for maps/zones that are in a level range equal to Your Botpack Level +-2, keep that in mind and plan ahead your Bot upgrades

     ###Zone Specific Contracts

     Those contracts are bound to specific zones which are determined accordingly to your Botpack level

<br>
Some [Contracts](/contracts) will make more Wild Bots (e.g. “Salvage the Caravan”) or Bandits (e.g. “Rescue the Guard”, “Rescue the Caravan”) appear in their specific region. You can use that in your favor to <em>grind specific enemy types</em> in order to complete your [Codex](/codex) tasks by beating them down without actually clearing the tasks, thus increasing their spawn density in multiple runs (do this by not salvaging that caravan or not talking to the NPC after clearing the area)
