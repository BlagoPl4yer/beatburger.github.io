<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-acquisition">

## Acquisition

- 1: boat lvl ?
- 2: boat lvl ?
- 3: boat lvl ?

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-managment">

## Managment 

Unlocked at Boat lvl ?, you can change their bots, abilities and boosters.

Make good use of it?

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-mechanics">

## Mechanics

Every recruit fight is simulated, so synergies (bots+abilities+boosters) matter. A [good recruit](#tips) can punch above its weight. 

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-squad">

## Squad Cup

You won't win that one alone!

### Common strats ?

### Tie Breaker

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-jobs">

## Jobs

Important revenue stream, some pretty neat rares & epics, and sometimes the easier way to get some annoying [Boat mats](/materials#boat) 

Jobs options reset every 6h

Full [Jobs list](/jobs)

### Tip

if you're waiting for Uberbot, try and pick short jobs so you know you'll have a chance to pick Uberbot at every reset

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-reinforcments">

## Reinforcments 

### Decoy

1 recruit = 1 less fight. Neat for Bosses/Megas !

### Farming

That's not your job, let them do it for you! [Farming](/farming)
</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-tips">

## Tips 

### "Hard to mess up" objective

Recruits are dumb. It's less about giving them a powerful comp, than it is about giving them tools they won't hurt themselves with. 

### Try to avoid

- bots: Mort, Brute, Scatter
- abilities: CT/SCT

### Try to prioritize:

- bots: Rocketeer, Dune Bug
- abilities: Hypercharge
