Recruits, how do they work ? They're the most useful tool you have in Botworld Adventure once you know how to handle them: **with love, care, and *watcheful supervision***.

**Jobs**: they're all listed in [Jobs](/jobs)

**Squad Cup**: is described in [Arena](/arena)

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-acquisition">

## Acquisition

- 1: boat lvl ?
- 2: boat lvl ?
- 3: boat lvl ?

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-managment">

## Managment 

Unlocked at Boat lvl ?, you can change their bots, abilities and boosters.

Make good use of it?

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-mechanics">

## Mechanics

Every recruit fight is simulated, so synergies (bots+abilities+boosters) matter. A [good recruit](#tips) can punch above its weight. 

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-squad">

## Squad Cup

You won't win that one alone!

### Common strats ?

### Tie Breaker

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-jobs">

## Jobs

Important revenue stream, some pretty neat rares & epics, and sometimes the easier way to get some annoying [Boat mats](/materials#boat) 

Jobs options reset every 6h

Full [Jobs list](/jobs)

### Tip

if you're waiting for Uberbot, try and pick short jobs so you know you'll have a chance to pick Uberbot at every reset

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-reinforcments">

## Reinforcments 

### Decoy

1 recruit = 1 less fight. Neat for Bosses/Megas !

### Farming

That's not your job, let them do it for you! [Farming](/farming)
</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-comp">


## Composition

### "Hard to mess up" objective

Recruits are dumb. It's less about giving them a powerful comp, than it is about giving them tools they won't hurt themselves with. 

Don't think *can this bot/ability do good with this recruit?* but rather *can my recruit use this bot/ability so poorly it doesn't even help it win a fight ?* 



### Avoid: easily-disabled bots

You'll see a recruit place a [Mort](/mort) in melee range of a bot, or fail to protect Mort if it's too close. Placing [Scatter](/scatter) or [Brute](/brute) too far away from the fight achieve the same result of doing absolutely nothing.

Any bot that needs a combo or some kind of help from the player (placement, supporting bots or abilities, etc) will do poorly in the hand of a recruit

**Suggested list of Bots to Avoid on your recruits:** [Mort](/mort), [Brute](/brute), [Scatter](/scatter), [Flamer](/flamer), [Beat](/beat), [Bigshot](/bigshot) (without [Stun Immunity](/comps#combos)), etc...


### Prioritize: self-reliant bots

On the other hand, bots like [Rocketeer](/Rocketeer) and [Dune Bug](/dune-bug) are very self-reliant bots, as most [Evaders](/bots#evaders) and [Splashers](/bots#splashers) (veto Mort) tend to be. Their **reliable damage, mobility, and effectiveness in hands-off situations** lend them to be more beneficial for recruits to pilot.


**Suggested list of Bots to Prioritize on your recruits:** [Rocketeer](/Rocketeer), [Dune Bug](/dune-bug), [Ram](/ram), [Thump](/thump), [Fork](/fork), [Virus](/virus), [Pluggie](/pluggie), [Longshot](/longshot), etc...


### Abilities

The same reasoning applies, give them abilities that require anything like planning ahead and watch them fail miserably.

Ever seen a recruit using [SCT](/sct) endlessly on [Brute](/brute) ? I have, that's fun, but achieve exactly nothing good:

- Brute never gets in range of anything to hit
- Spend every ounce of power available

All of a sudden the fight is **3 bots + botpack** (the opponent) *vs* **2 bots + no botpack** (your recruit). Not great.

Thinking of giving your recruit Hasty Ground ? Well here's hoping it uses it on [KO](/ko) and not [Bigshot](/bigshot). etc.


**Avoid abilities that *can easily* be wasted:** [Chaos Translocator](/chaos-translocator), [Supercharged Chaos Translocator](/supercharged-chaos-translocator),... [more to add](/contribute#tbw)

**Prioritize abilities that *will always* have a beneficial outcome:** [Hypercharge](/hypercharge), Direct damage or Poison, [Shield](/shield),... [more to add](/contribute#tbw)


### Try it out!

The best way to figure out what works and what doesn't for a recruit comps, is *simply* to just go and **spectate it in action**. Either:

- **Squad Cup:** whenever available. Take notes, maybe even record ?
- **Autobattle:** load up the 4 bots you have in mind for your recruit comp, add 2 lvl 1 bots you have left in your boat, and have a few fights in the wild. It's not the exact same thing but close enough that you will surely learn a lot, I know I have!



## AI Priorities

The recruits/autobattle AI clearly has favorite bots/abilities and its own priority rules. 

[Anyone got data on that?](/contribute#tbw)
