# Loot, locations & droprates


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">

## Loot piles, zoning, etc.

## Botframes

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-botframes">

Random drops can happen anywhere from any source (piles, chests, fights...). Higher rarity chests have better chances of dropping higher rarity botframes.
Type of Wild Bots, zone location, etc., have no impact over which botframes you're most likely to find.

Any bot you can get through a special mean (reward of any kind) is only available through that mean (at that time). 
The rest is from random drops.

## Ancient Ruins

Ancient Ruins are traces of the old civilizations of human. Example: Old train tracks, buildings and Etc. There are some everywhere but in Scavengers Coast

**Look out for the blue-ish buildings all around the map, and loot piles or chests nearby.**
