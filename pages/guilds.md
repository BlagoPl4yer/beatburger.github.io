# Guilds

## Introduction

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">
Guilds are groups of players who can chat amongst and help each other, exchange battling tactics, and complete collective [tasks](#completing-objectives) for [events](#events).

 The maximum strength of a guild is **20 members**.
</div>

## Completing Objectives

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-objectives">
Different [events](#events) have specific **tasks** that need to be completed within a given timeframe. Completing these tasks would give rewards to all the guild members which can be claimed after the event ends. Generally, there are three objectives in each event and three tiers of rewards (Mega Chests, Ability Modules, Costumes, etc.)
