# Development roadmap

## Explanations
I've started to receive bug reports, suggestions, ideas, all sorts of contributions. I obviously can't do everything at once so I need some kind of todo-list, and this page is where I'll share it with you so you can:

- Make sure that I haven't forgotten to add you thing to it :')
- Understand why it maybe hasn't been done yet, the list is sorted by priority level
- Pick anything in here you want to tackle and write the content for !


## Roadmap

### Follow-up on contributions

I make it my first priority for now to make sure we can all move along on this, and nothing's more frustrating than to do some work and not see it used so I'll do my best to make contributing rewarding for everyone !

So anything that's blocking someone to contribute, or necessary for a contribution to be valorised, takes priority.

Basically, I want to focus on building the project & team first, the website second. We'll go way further this way I'm sure !

### Major tech fixes

- Search design

### Important Content Pages / Features

- boosters template + converter
- breadcrumbs
- Editor Mode edits merge process (converter ?)
- Search scope
- rarity sorted
- 

### Minor tech fixes

- minified menu glitch at the top of the page
- distorded BB logo
- images compression
- alt/titles
- as edits cool down, and virus grow, remove the cache breaker on edits.json
-  embed discord widget on the sidebar
-  extract inline css & js
-  remove cache buster
-  Search -> dispatcher.js

### Secondary content & features ideas

- redirects: /sct -> /supercharged-chaos-translocator etc
- sortable lists
- dedicated favicon
- dynamic maps

## Notes

- **Updating**: I'll update this list regularly, but the main version is locally on my laptop so don't be surprised is the published one is a few hours behind.

- **Priority levels**: represented here from High (top) to low (bottom). Open to discussion about it obv, you know where to ping me.

- **Exhaustivity**: I'm doing lots of tech stuff as they go and pop in my mind, so don't be surprised if you see stuff on changelof that weren't in here before. It'll slowly die over time as the website gets ready and doesn't need as much small fixes everywhere.
