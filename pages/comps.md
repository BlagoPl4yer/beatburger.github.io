# Comps & Combos: Strategy Guide
  
<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-main">

Your Composition of [Bots](/bots) & [Botpack Modules](/botpack) (comp) is what defines what kind of Botmaster you will be in a fight.

Powerful combos are the cornerstone of any good comp, and some will only involve bots, but others will rely on [Abilities](/abilities) or [Boosters](/boosters)

## Grouper Comp

The general idea behind a Grouper Comp is to get all 3 opponent bots grouped up and nuke them all at once with heavy [AoE](/fighting#aoe) damage.

### Grouping

This stategy is extremelly reliable thanks to [Chainer](/chainer)'s Ultimate ability, with the right AI perks. It will group all the bots in line of sight right from the begining of the battle!

You can actually make it work without Chainer to some extend, in some situations:

- **[Wild Bots](/exploring#wild-bots):** sometimes they're already grouped, you can then skip Chainer and use a better [Tank](/bots#tanks) or another AoE bot.
- **With the right [Abilities](/abilities):** some abilities work very well to group bots, and sometimes that's enough: [Vortex](/vortex), [Gravity Surge](/gravity-surge), [Gust](/gust)...
- **With the right [Bots](/bots):** [Lobbie](/lobbie), [Mort](/mort)


### AoE

Now to the blasting! The most straight-forward is to deal them loads of damage, but powerfull [CC](fighting#cc) works really well too. Not much they can do if they're stun-locked.

There are many sources of [AoE](/fighting#aoe) effects for you to choose from, that you can combine however it suits you best. For bots, most [Splashers](/bots#splashers) are viable there, but not only are interesting AoE options. What matters most is that the AoE effect comes fast enough that your grouping is still effective when it lands. AI perks play a big role there.

- **Ranged Bots:** [Mort](/mort), [Pluggie](/pluggie), [Lobbie](/lobbie), [Bigshot](/bigshot), [Dune Bug](/dune-bug), [Sheller?](/sheller)...
- **Melee-range Bots:** [Brute](/brute), [Flamer](/flamer), [Scatter](/scatter)
- **AoE CC Bots:** [Lobbie](/lobbie), [Scatter](/scatter), [Pluggie](/pluggie), [Sheller?](/sheller)...
- **AoE abilities:** [Icewall](/icewall), [Hack Missile](/hack-missile), [Poison Trail](/poison-trail), [Goop](/goop), [Zap Tower](/zap-tower), [Poison Tower](/poison-tower), [Frost Missile](/frost-missile)...

As you can see, you're not lacking options there!

### Opener

Grouper Comps are all about a powerful opener. Hopefully that's enough to close the fight!

Thus, you'll usually want build such a comp around:

- **3-4 opening Bots:** [Chainer](/chainer), 2 main AoE bots, and probably 1 backup AoE bot as a safety net.
- **Ult-friendly [Botpack Modules](/botpack):** [Abilities](/abilities) and [Boosters](/boosters) that will make your bots cast their Ultimates faster or more often. [Ult Start](/ult-start-special) or [Ult Cooldowns](/ult-cooldowns-rare) boosters, [Hypercharge](/hypercharge)...
- **First-strike [Botpack Modules](/botpack):** [Abilities](/abilities) and [Boosters](/boosters) that will help you make your opener fatal. [Power Start](/power-start-epic) boosters (any rarity), AoE abilities listed above, or Abilities that are combo very aggressively with your AoE bots like [SCT](/sct) or [Charge Field](/charge-field).

### Cleanup & Utility

Your 2-3 free bot slots

- **Cleaner:** But sometimes the opener isn't enough to actually close the fight by itself, like when your opponent has 6 bots in [Arena](/arena) or they're a [Boss](/exploring#bosses). That's what you need Cleaners for. They're usually high mobility or ranged bots: [Fork](/fork), [Ram](/ram), [Virus](/virus) (Hack is ranged), [Longshot](/longshot)...
- **Utility:** It's good to save 1 or 2 bot slots to have the right counter in difficult situations. Like [Mega Bots](/exploring#mega-bots) or when your [Canister](/exploring#canister) is getting empty. Maybe then you'd rather use a regular tanky [Tank](/bots#tanks) instead of Chainer whenever you can do without it and save some of its precious HP.

## Combos

### Nuclear Mort

[SCT](/sct) your [Mort](/mort) while its ult's cannon ball is mid-flight for a devastating first strike.

### Undying Frosty

Go full [Energy Resistance boosters](/energy-resistance-epic) with bots that can also get Energy Resistance from their [AI tree](/bots#ai]. 

[Frosty](/frosty) being a natural counter to every Melee bot, make him invulnerable to most Ranged bot & every [Ability](/abilities), and, well... just watch.

### Gang Up Time

Gather the most devastating Melee-range bots [Brute](/brute), [Scatter](/scatter), [Flamer](/flamer), that are usually held back by their lack of mobility. Add [Team Translocator](/team-translocator), and watch them melt down the opposition.

### Stun Immunity

Having 2 [Epic Stun Resist boosters](/stun-resistance-epic) grants your bots 100% stun (and freeze) immunity. That's extremely valuable to [Bigshot](/bigshot)!
