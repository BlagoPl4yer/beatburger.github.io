# Comps & Combos
  
<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-main">

Your Composition of [Bots](/bots) & Botpack Modules](/botpack) (comp) is what defines what kind of Botmaster you will be in a fight.

Powerful combos are the cornerstone of any good comp, and some will only involve bots, but others will rely on [Abilities](/abilities) or [Boosters](/boosters)

## Combos

### Nuclear Mort

[SCT](/sct) your [Mort](/mort) while its ult's cannon ball is mid-flight for a devastating first strike.

### Undying Frosty

Go full [Energy Resistance boosters](/energy-resistance-epic) with bots that can also get Energy Resistance from their [AI tree](/bots#ai]. 

[Frosty](/frosty) being a natural counter to every Melee bot, make him invulnerable to most Ranged bot & every [Ability](/abilities), and, well... just watch.

### Gang Up Time

Gather the most devastating Melee-range bots [Brute](/brute), [Scatter](/scatter), [Flamer](/flamer), that are usually held back by their lack of mobility. Add [Team Translocator](/team-translocator), and watch them melt down the opposition.
