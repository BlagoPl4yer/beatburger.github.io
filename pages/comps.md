# Comps & Combos: Strategy Guide
  
<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-main">

Your Composition of [Bots](/bots) & [Botpack Modules](/botpack) (comp) is what defines what kind of Botmaster you will be in a fight.

Powerful combos are the cornerstone of any good comp, and some will only involve bots, but others will rely on [Abilities](/abilities) or [Boosters](/boosters)

## Grouper Comp

The general idea behind a Grouper Comp is to get all 3 opponent bots grouped up and nuke them all at once with heavy [AoE](</fighting#aoe>) damage.

### Grouping

This stategy is extremelly reliable thanks to [Chainer](</chainer>)'s Ultimate ability, with the right AI perks and [Botpack Boosters](</boosters>). It will group all the bots in line of sight right from the begining of the battle!

You can actually make it work without Chainer to some extend, in some situations:

- **[Wild Bots](</exploring#wild-bots>):** sometimes they're already grouped, you can then skip Chainer and use a better [Tank](</bots#tanks>) or another AoE bot.
- **With the right [Abilities](</abilities>):** some abilities work very well to group bots, and sometimes that's enough: [Vortex](</vortex>), [Gravity Surge](</gravity-surge>), [Gust](</gust>)...
- **With the right [Bots](</bots>):** [Lobbie](</lobbie>), [Mort](</mort>)


### AoE

Now to the blasting! The most straight-forward is to deal them loads of damage, but powerfull [CC\]\() works really well too. Not much they can do if they're stun-locked.

There are many sources of [AoE](</fighting#aoe>) effects for you to choose from, that you can combine however it suits you best. For bots, most [Splashers](</bots#splashers>) are viable there, but not only are interesting AoE options. What matters most is that the AoE effect comes fast enough that your grouping is still effective when it lands. AI perks play a big role there.

- **Ranged Bots:**[Mort](</mort>), [Pluggie](</pluggie>), [Lobbie](</lobbie>), [Bigshot](</bigshot>), [Dune Bug](</dune-bug>), [Sheller?](</sheller>)…
- **Melee-range Bots:**[Brute](</brute>), [Flamer](</flamer>), [Scatter](</scatter>)
- **AoE CC Bots:**[Lobbie](</lobbie>), [Scatter](</scatter>), [Pluggie](</pluggie>), [Sheller?](</sheller>)…
- **AoE abilities:**[Icewall](</icewall>), [Hack Missile](</hack-missile>), [Poison Trail](</poison-trail>), [Goop](</goop>), [Zap Tower](</zap-tower>), [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>), [Frost Missile](</frost-missile>)…


As you can see, you're not lacking options there!

### Opener

Grouper Comps are all about a powerful opener. Hopefully that's enough to close the fight!

Thus, you'll usually want build such a comp around:

- **3-4 opening Bots:**[Chainer](</chainer>), 2 main AoE bots, and probably 1 backup AoE bot as a safety net.
- **Ult-friendly [Botpack Modules](</botpack>):**[Abilities](</abilities>) and [Boosters](</boosters>) that will make your bots cast their Ultimates faster or more often. [Ult Start](</ult-start-special>) or [Ult Cooldowns](</ult-cooldowns-rare>) boosters, [Hypercharge](</hypercharge>)…
- **First-strike [Botpack Modules](</botpack>):**[Abilities](</abilities>) and [Boosters](</boosters>) that will help you make your opener fatal. [Power Start](</power-start-epic>) boosters (any rarity), AoE abilities listed above, or Abilities that are combo very aggressively with your AoE bots like [SCT](</sct>), [Charge Field](</charge-field>) or [Vanish](</vanish>).


### Cleanup & Utility

Your 2-3 free bot slots

- **Cleaner:** But sometimes the opener isn’t enough to actually close the fight by itself, like when your opponent has 6 bots in [Arena](</arena>) or they’re a [Boss](</exploring#bosses>). That’s what you need Cleaners for. They’re usually high mobility or ranged bots: [Fork](</fork>), [Ram](</ram>), [Virus](</virus>) (Hack is ranged), [Longshot](</longshot>)…
- **Utility:** It’s good to save 1 or 2 bot slots to have the right counter in difficult situations. Like [Mega Bots](</exploring#mega-bots>) or when your [Canister](</exploring#canister>) is getting empty. Maybe then you’d rather use a regular tanky [Tank](</bots#tanks>) instead of Chainer whenever you can do without it and save some of its precious HP.


### Bot Options

<br>

<br>

[Chainer](</chainer>)<br>

**Pros**:

- It's the star of this strategy, since it's the one Bot that'll makes it not completely reliant on the enemy's placement
- Easy to get through the [Arena](</arena>) (1000 trophies)**Cons**:
- None<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- It'll only be able to ult right off the bat once he hits AI level 5 and with the addition of 2x [Ult Charge](</ult-charge-special>) Botpack Boosters<br>



<br>

[Mort](</mort>)<br>

**Pros**:

- It has the highest AoE physical damage burst there is
- Grants 2x Botpack Energy when placed with the Power Link AI Perk (AI Lv1)<br>



**Cons**:

- Easily bothered, won't attack if there's an enemy unit close to it, needing active babysitting<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- It'll only be able to ult right off the bat once it hits AI level 5 and with the addition of 2x [Ult Charge](</ult-charge-special>) Botpack Boosters
- [SCT](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>) and [Vanish](</vanish>), when correctly timed, will double it's Super Shell's damage<br>



<br>

[Lobbie](</lobbie>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Has consistent AoE damage and doesn't need babysitting like [Mort](</mort>)
- It's Ult will help to keep enemies grouped up
- Grants 2x Botpack Energy when placed with the Power Link AI perk (AI Lv5)<br>



**Cons**:

- None<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- It's ult can either stun enemies or increase the damage they take by 30%
- You can choose between Lobbie ulting right off the bat (Pre-Charged) or getting 2x Botpack Energy (Power Link) once he gets to AI Lv5<br>



<br>

[Pluggie](</pluggie>)<br>

**Pros**:

- An all-round [Splasher](</splasher>), having CC, great AoE damage and counter-melee tools in it's kit
- Has both energy damage resistance and melee damage reflection
- Great stats<br>



**Cons**:

- Not so easy to get for new players (2000 trophies in [Arena](</arena>))
- The way it's AoE works isn't as reliable as [Mort](</mort>)'s or [Lobbie](</lobbie>)'s<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- One of the best Bots in game and is as good as a Cleaner as it is as an Opener, thus a great choice for either of these roles<br>



<br>

[Brute](</brute>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Very high AoE physical damage that doesn't require [Ult Charge](</ult-charge-special>) boosters<br>



**Cons**:

- The radius of it's Spin isn't affected by [Bot Effect Area](</bot-effect-area-rare>) boosters and it can be tricky hit all enemies at once<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- Can only use Spin right off the bat once it reaches Ai Lv5<br>



<br>

[Bombee](</bombee>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Great placement damage + stun
- One of the greatest AoE *booms* with Self-Destruct
- *So much fun*<br>



**Cons**:

- Not really viable since it'd either need 4x [Ult Charges](</ult-charge-special>) or 2x [Ult Charges](</ult-charge-special>) \+ 2x [Rare Ult Cooldowns](</ult-cooldowns-rare>) in order to ult right off the bat
- Canister-heavy since it'll die while ulting<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- ***So much fun***<br>



<br>

[Flamer](</flamer>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Consistent AoE damage
- Since bots try to walk out of it's ult, they won't attack while in it (combo really well with [Vortex](</vortex>))<br>



**Cons**:

- It's AI is currently bugged, so you'll need to use 3x [Ult Charges\]\() to guarantee that it'd ult consistently
- Flamer is really squishy and has a really short range, so it'll be easily killed if the Opening combo doesn't clear the field<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- It's AI seems to get stuck once he start attacking, so even after it's ult is charged Flamer won't trigger it until it's target either dies or moves out of the Flamethrower's range, thus skills like [SCT](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>) and [Gust](</gust>) can come at hand. [Frosty](</frosty>)'s AI seems to have a similar problem.<br>



<br>

[Bigshot](</bigshot>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Extremely high piercing damage
- Specially efficient at [Boss](</bosses>) fights and [Danger Zones](</danger-zones>)<br>



**Cons**:

- It takes long to charge and will be often bullied by enemy Bandit's abilities
- Hitting all enemies at once might be hard since it's attacks are piercing shots, instead or proper AoEs like [Mort](</mort>)'s<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- Using 2x [Epic Stun Resistance](</stun-resistance-epic>) will make it immune to stuns, preventing enemies from interrupting it's charging
- Synergizes really well with [Vanish](</vanish>). Both [Vanish](</vanish>) and [SCT](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>) can be used to double it's shots damage<br>



<br>

[Beat](</beat>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Can double your bot's damage and increase their speed by 20% with Inspire
- Nice AoE stun with Soundwave (ult)
- Can almost be considered a [Brawler](</brawlers>) due to how tanky and tough it can be<br>



**Cons**:

- Isn't easily obtained by new players (3000 trophies in [Arena](</arena>))<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- Inspire will only be available right off the bat once it reaches AI Lv4<br>



<br>

[Rocketeer](</rocketeer>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Great against melee enemies, specially melee [Mega Bots](</bosses#mega-bots>) and [Super Bots](</bosses#super-bots>)
- Really easy to obtain early on (special Botframe)
- Very self-reliable, demanding close to no active support from [Abilities](</abilities>)<br>



**Cons**:

- Low damage output
- It's knockback effects can move enemies away from eachother in some cases<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- It's a great option for [Recruits](</recruits>) in early to mid game, so the invested materials won't go to waste once you replace it with a stronger [Splasher](</splasher>)<br>



<br>

[Tether](</tether>)<br>

**Pros**:

- It's ult will keep enemies still for a considerable time and can increase the damage they take by 30% once he reaches AI Lv5
- Is specially efficient against [Mega Bots](</bosses#mega-bots>) and [Super Bots](</bosses#super-bots>) since Immobilize isn't affected by their Stun Resistance
- Really easy to unlock early on (special Botframe)<br>



**Cons**:

- It's easily outclassed by other bots in most scenarios<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- It's basic attacks can gain a piercing effect once he reaches AI Lv1
- Can gain Slow and Immobilize immunity once it reaches AI Lv3<br>



<br>

[Halo](</halo>)<br>

**Pros**:

- A great Supporter that can be built toward offense or defence
- It gives out shields that can block all incoming damage and boosts that doubles a bot damage (also doubles speed once it reaches AI Lv3)
- Grants 2x Botpack Energy when placed with the Power Link AI Perk (AI Lv4)<br>



**Cons**:

- Really low damage output
- It'll often give both buffs to the same bot, meaning you can't use 100% of it's potential in most situations<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- Once reaching AI Lv5 you can choose if it'll get either the Shield ready (Shield Preloader) or the Boost 50% charged (Booster Preloader) once placed. In case you choose Boost Preloader it can be ready right off the bat with the addition of 2x [Ult Charge](</ult-charge-special>) boosters<br>



<br>

[Nozzle](</nozzle>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Stuns nearby enemies upon placement
- Consistent piercing damage (AI Lv2) and CC
- Works really well as a second line tanker since it can get Physical Resistance for the AI tree (AI Lv5) and has the Hide skill<br>



**Cons**:

- New players won't be getting it any time soon (4000 trophies in [Arena](</arena>))
- Hide is RnG based, so it's not 100% reliable<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- None<br>



<br>

[Pupil](</pupil>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Better used as a Cleaner, but has a high piercing damage output with Ultra Beam
- Has natural stun immunity while casting Ultra Beam (AI Lv4)<br>



**Cons**:

- It won't have the ult ready right off the bat unless you use either 4x [Ult Charges](</ult-charge-special>) or 2x [Ult Charges](</ult-charge-special>) \+ 2x [Rare Ult Cooldowns](</ult-cooldowns-rare>)
- Demands active support with [Abilities](</abilities>) to keep enemies from moving away from it's lasers<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- None<br>



<br>

[Dunebug](</dunebug>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Great self-reliant Cleaner
- Can have consistent piercing damage with the right AI perks (AI Lv2)
- It's ult can be devastating once reaches AI Lv5
- Very self-reliant, demanding close to no active support from [Abilities](</abilities>)
- Specially effective against melee [Mega Bots](</bosses#mega-bots>) and [Super Bots](</bosses#super-bots>)
- Can be easily obtained by new players (Story Quest)<br>



**Cons**:

- **Really** squishy<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- Since it's really self-reliant it's a great option for [Recruits](</recruits>), meaning that your invested materials won't go to waste if you decide to replace it with another Bot later on<br>



<br>

[Froggy](</froggy>)<br>

**Pros**:

- Very elusive and self-reliant [Starter Bot](</starter-bots>)
- Poison Tank can pack quite the punch and will be available right off the bat with the right AI Perks (AI Lv5) and the addition of 2x [Ult Charge](</ult-charge-special>)
- Since Poison Tank deals Poison Damage it won't be reduced by neither Energy nor Physicial resistance
- Nice CC<br>



**Cons**:

- Has no AoE damage aside from Poison Tank, which has it's cooldown increased by 25% by the AI perk needed for the Opening combo
- Tends to scale poorly in power, making it less efficient the further you progress in the game<br>



**Worth to mention**:

- None<br>

### Nuclear Mort

[Vanish](</vanish>) your [Mort](</mort>) right before he ults or [SCT](</sct>) him while its cannon ball is mid-flight for a devastating first strike.

- [video](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/879389444812206110/931894458797146152/XRecorder_Edited_15012022_135455.mp4>)

### Undying Frosty

Go full [Energy Resistance boosters](</energy-resistance-epic>) with bots that can also get Energy Resistance from their [AI tree](</bots#ai>).

[Frosty](</frosty>) being a natural counter to every Melee bot, make him invulnerable to most Ranged bot & every [Ability](</abilities>), and, well... just watch.

### Gang Up Time

Gather the most devastating Melee-range bots [Brute](</brute>), [Scatter](</scatter>), [Flamer](</flamer>), that are usually held back by their lack of mobility. Add [Team Translocator](</team-translocator>), and watch them melt down the opposition.

### Stun Immunity

Having 2 [Epic Stun Resist boosters](</stun-resistance-epic>) grants your bots 100% stun (and freeze) immunity. That's extremely valuable to [Bigshot](</bigshot>)!

### Bigshot + Gravity Surge or Vortex

### Chainer + Unstable Plasma

### Big Poison Missile with Hornet

### Bombee Flamer combo

### Bullseye + Barrier Wall
