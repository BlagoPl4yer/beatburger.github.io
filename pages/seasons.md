# Seasons


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">

## Starter Season vs Global Season

You have to go through the Starter Season before you can get into the current Global Season with the rest of the older players.

Any bot that's available as a reward in your current season, you can't find it as a random drop or in any chest. 
When the season expires however, it'll become available this way (including premium rewards)
