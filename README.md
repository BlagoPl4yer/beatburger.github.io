# Botworld Wiki Project

- Our objective is to provide the best resource possible for Botworld Adventure, at: https://www.botworld.wiki/
- The project is coordinated from the official discord server: https://discord.com/invite/FsJzvtFrgq


## Project Organization

### Overview 

**Content Types**

Most of the content present on the site can be broken down into the following categories:

- [Content sections](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/blob/main/README.md#content) (manually written content with potentially links & medias)
- [Entity pages](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/blob/main/README.md#entities) (bots, abilities, boosters, materials are all imported and a page is automatically generated)
- [Entities lists](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/blob/main/README.md#entities) (automatically lists the desired infos for the selected entities)

Some special and more advanced cases, best left to the most accustomed maintainers:

- Navigation blocks
- Dynamic features: Search, Upgrade Calculator...
- Custom Embeds (for discord integration)

## HowTos

### Content

**Using Editor Mode (Editors)**

This mode aims to provide a **simple and straightforward** way for everyone to edit **specific sections** of the content. In order to lower the skill requirements to contribute this way, the **edition capabilities are restricted to simple and localized edits**.
